    "This module implements HI-LO card-counting.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module, the true count is evaluated to be (running count) / (no. unseen decks).\n",

    "Implementation consists of two modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The player_bet module uses the true count to vary the player bets, as defined above.\n",

    "\n",

    "* The updated running count, total cards dealt and true count are then stored for use in the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A feature needs to be added at the control flow level whereby the true count, running count and total cards dealt are reset to 0 after the shoe has been shuffled (i.e. the replenish shoe module has been triggered).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to emphasise that the new true count is computed and updated using the player hand, the dealer hand, the running count, and the total cards dealt.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Need to amend the way that payouts and losses are computed - as we will no longer be using constant bets per round, but rather, a bet informed by the true count.\n",
