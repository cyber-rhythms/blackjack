    "Objective 1b - build a working model of multiple rounds of Blackjack, with betting functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of functionalities that I would like to build into the module in another script to start answering some meatier questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple betting module that can in its most simplest iteration specify a player's betting behaviour.\n",
    "It must be able to accurately compute amounts paid out at the end of each hand.\n",
    "It must be able to track amounts paid out by the dealer, and amounts won by the player historically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amend the existing modules to simulate the effect of multiple rounds being played in one \"shoe\", as is done in casinos, and this is crucial to assess the effects of card counting as a later objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Skeleton module completed. Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Module can encode initial capital stock, simple rule-based player betting behaviour at the beginning. \n",
    "* Module can simulate multiple hands being played.\n",
    "* Module can compute payoffs and losses at the end of each hand, with caveats, and store the evolution of the player's capital stock, which can subsequently accessed for statistical analysis.\n",
    "* Module can simulate the effects of reshuffling close to the end of the shoe. Frequency of reshuffling is controlled by a user defined threshold parameter that represents the cards remaining as a proportion of the total number of cards that the casino uses at the beginning of the shoe."
