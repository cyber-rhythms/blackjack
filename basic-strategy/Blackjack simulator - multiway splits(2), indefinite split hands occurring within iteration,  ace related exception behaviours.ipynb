    "* At what level should this be included? Inside main decision module (basic_player_multiple_hits) or as part of CF within player_multiple_turns?\n",
    "* Decided to place it at level of CF within player_multiple_turns as it is a minority case/exception behaviour that only occurs within context of splitting. This can also cover resplitting aces; we check the hand and see if there is only one ace. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Resplitting aces - you can resplit aces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split aces and blackjack - you can only get a standard 21 after you have split aces, and cannot blackjack - no need for blackjack detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As playerblackjack indicator is only set during openinghand(); it will be set to zero by default. And also if it was set to 1 in the openinghand(), we wouldn't get to the splitting stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exception thrown when one of the subhands is of the blackjack variety i.e. hand = [A, K/Q/J/10] and corresponding permutat. Using the existing basic_player_multiple_hits decision module; as player_blackjack variable is set during opening hands, the decision module will treat this hand as a soft total and perform a lookup, and the BS strategy table will NOT contain any of AJ, AQ, AK (although A10 will be there as it was placed there to deal with three card soft totals).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design consideration: Either amend the decision module; or the basic strategy table; or the CF inside player_multiple_turn()\n",
    "module. Opted for the last option, but it is currently looking a little ugly - lots of ifs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exception thrown when splitting one hand e.g. [A, A], yields TWO further [A, A], [A, A] hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pathological behaviour 1 - 2 pairs occurring after 1st decision-action sequence in for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original multiwaysplit code was written assuming that only one of the new hands would have a pair, NOT both.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original player_multiple_turn() logic: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume as usual that player_action_parent() has already produced a list of lists and populated it with cards; so we start with player_split_hands = [[A, 2], [A, A]].\n",
    "* Element[0] will be resolved in 1st iteration.\n",
    "* Then we get to element[1]\n",
    "* decision = {Sp}\n",
    "* Assuming next two cards are A, A, then new player_split_hands = [[A, 2], [A, A], [A, A]] and new hands [A, A] and [A, A]\n",
    "* player = player_split_hands[1] = [A, A]\n",
    "* IF conditional will be triggered as decision = {Sp}\n",
    "* Then decision = basic_player_multiple_hits(player, dealer, player_blackjack) = {Sp}\n",
    "* Assuming new cards are 4, 9, then new player split hands will be = [[A, 2], [A, 4], [A, 9], [A, A]] and new hands [A, 4], [A,9]\n",
    "* player = player_split_hands[1] = [A, 4]\n",
    "* BUT THEN this will be passed to playerturn(), which will recommend H, and so the force decision - {S} will be missed, card will be drawn and error.\n",

    "* Pathological behaviour 2 - indefinite numbers of pairs occuring after 1st decision-action sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Reverted back to multiwaysplit(1) if conditional; with the minor amendments for ace exceptions. Works fine and seems to be consistent with final output for multiwaysplits(1), but you need to double check. \n",
