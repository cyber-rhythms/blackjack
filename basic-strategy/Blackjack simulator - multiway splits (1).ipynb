    "* Module is now working for 7-way split. Technically it should be able to run for any number of splits. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Write this as function - done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Investigate whether there will be an issue with playerturn() module INSIDE the for loop (to be placed in function) being called, as it calls the unmodified player_action() function. That contains a legacy decision = {Sp} piece of code using old variable assignments. Feeling is that nature of the CF in the main function means that it never will get passed a decision = {Sp}, and this is dealt with by player_action_parent and player_action_child. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Investigate whether the issue of hastily specified decision = {Sp} and a bust_indicator assignment is redundant. Feeling is that it is - according to CF diagrams, splits are dealt with during the 1st decision-action sequence (whether parent or child); and so by the time you get to PT, either a decision = {S,D} was taken, or player blackjacked, so no need to consider this possibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Function, for loop and individual iterations now all harmonised -> move on to the score computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Error 1: This code cannot deal with two pairs being drawn after the decision-action sequence in the for loop has determined a split. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As the commands inside IF conditional will generate a further split decision and reindex player, which in our case will be itself a pair, a pair and decision = {Sp} will be passed to playerturn(). This will then do nothing' and decision will be recorded in array as 'Sp', bust_indicator as 0, hand will be recorded as pair, which has been UNRESOLVED. So for 2 pairs being drawn, the IF conditional will only call ONE decision-action sequence before moving to resolve the hand, rather than TWO times. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Error 2: Following from error 1, this module cannot deal with long runs of the same card (in this example 7), coming after the first decision-action sequence on the iterable, that is indefinite numbers of pairs coming after the 1st decision-action sequence in the for loop iterator has been executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "These and some exceptional behaviour involving aces are all dealt with in multiway splits (2)."
