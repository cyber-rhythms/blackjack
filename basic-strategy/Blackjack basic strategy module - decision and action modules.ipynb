    "* The dimensionality of the problem is increasing a lot, feels a little combinatorial as splits create a branching factor. And there are complexities in the above aspects. I am investigating whether it is at all possible in a realistic timeframe to code this up solely using functions, in particuar because my attentions has been drawn to the fact that classes can keep track of states. \n",
    "* Follow up: With a little thought, and some pen/paper methods, the issue is that each split creates a branching factor of 2, i.e. it creates two separate player hands which individually need to be looked up, and following the lookup, there will be four possible actions for each hand, yielding a total of 8 possible actions. It can be easy to get lost in all of this. But there is a self-styled cybernetic principle, which is that when looking at the evolution of behaviour of a system, examine its constraints. The importance of this becomes clearer when we consider that this may be used to limit how far we need to expand combinatorially. \n",
    "* Strategy: The key constraints here, in order of the extent to which they limit the branching of the decision tree, are the number of positions on the table it is possible to open with a separate bet. And also player capital.\n",
    "* Revision: On checking, it turns out there is no relationship between number of boxes/positions on the table, and the number of hands a player can split....\n",
    "* Thought: Impose an artificial limit \n",
    "* Revision2: Came from the question of how frequently I will encounter multi-way splits. Coding practice suggests that one should not spend too much time coding for non-existent events. Abusing the boudnary between rare and non-existent, how frequently will multi-way splits occur? Was going to say look at the table, but examining it, there are some features of conditional probability/combinatorics I don't currently feel necessitates serious exploration. The key is next point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strategy2: A constraint on the number of splits that will occur is the number of the \"same\" cards in the deck and the number of 52-card decks used. \n",
    "* Consider an arbitrary split on opening hand e.g. 2,2 for a 52-card deck. There will now be 2 hands, each containing one 2. If after hitting on both, either hand or both hands get a 2, then there will be 4 hands to play in total. This will be the maximum number of hands generated through splitting actions.\n",
    "* Consider an arbitrary split on an opening hands again e.g. 2,2 for a 2 52-cards decks. Then there will now be a maximum of 8 possible hands being played. \n",
    "* Following same logic, for an arbitrary split, and using n 52-card decks, there will be a maxmimum of 4n hands being played, corresponding to 4 hands for every 52-card deck being used (as this defines the total number of the same card value in circulation).\n",
    "* So for 6 decks, which is the standard for casino play, there will be a maxmimum of 24 possible hands resulting from splitting an arbitrary opening hand...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strategy3: Reduce unnecessary complexity, and impose artificial limit, as these cases may be extreme edge cases, in particular the maximum for 6 decks - 24 possible hands! However, only if it really is that hard to extend the look up table to more than 2 hands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key detail I may have missed and need to check - the exact process when a split happens. Was under the impression that after splitting, you have two 1-card hands from which you can either stick, double, hit.\n",

    "Soft/hard hands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This required a few hours of thought...but I got there in the end and it is remarkably simple. Perhaps I would got it more quickly if I thought aloud. \n",

    "If the sum of the remaining cards is less than or equal to 10, then this can be either 1 or 11, and is converted into A2 - A10, which can be looked up in the basic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sum of the remaing cards is greater than or equal to 11, then this becomes a hard total and is converted into 12 - 21, which can be looked up.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is more than one ace in the hand, only one ace will have the value 11. Use the above conditions to determine the lookup. \n",

    "\n",
    "Will have to return to this as an amendment as don't want to disrupt flow\n",

    "If the dealer's card is an ace, there is the possibility of a black-jack specific insurance side bet.  - all dealth with in ML journal.\n",

    "Issue with 2 card decision module, to do with unbound variables. That's because I was passing a nonsensical input i.e. player = ['A', 'K'] AND player_blackjack = 0 simultaneously, so decision variable was not being bound as a result of this limbo condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "But issue remains with multiple card hand decision module - solved. Typo when checking the number of cards in the hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now have a roughshod basic_strategy decision module that can handle multiple cards in a hand, and can compute and lookup BS table with soft and hard hands. Well done! Now for more progress."
