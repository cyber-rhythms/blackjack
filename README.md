# Blackjack simulator and analysis.

This directory contains materials I produced in February 2020 as part of a side-project exploring the statistical principles underpinning HI-LO card counting in Blackjack. These have been lying as undocumented Jupter notebooks, and need tidying up.

## Directory contents.

The contents of this directory are as follows

1. `environment.yml` - for users wishing to run the code in a conda environment.
2. `requirements.txt` - for users wishing to run the code in a Python virtual environment.
3. `blackjack.pptx` - a Powerpoint I wrote to assist in teaching talented A-level further maths students the statistical principles behind card-counting.
4. `/scripts` - contains a Blackjack simulator that implements Basic Strategy and HI-LO card counting.
5. `/analysis`- time-series analysis of the simulator.
6. `/figures` - figures generated by the script
7. `/logs` - simulator log files generated by the script.
